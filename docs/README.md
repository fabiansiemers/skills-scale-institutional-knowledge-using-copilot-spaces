# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This collection of process guides provides a comprehensive framework for delivering customer-focused projects through iterative, high-quality execution. Whether you're a new team member looking to understand how we work or an experienced contributor seeking specific process guidance, these documents outline our approach to project initiation, planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement.

OctoAcme's project management methodology is built on core principles of customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our process spans the complete project lifecycle—from initial problem validation and stakeholder alignment during **initiation**, through detailed backlog creation and dependency mapping in **planning**, to day-to-day execution with continuous integration, automated testing, and quality assurance practices. Every project is supported by a comprehensive set of **roles and personas** including Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who implement and test features, UX Designers who ensure usability and accessibility, Scrum Masters who facilitate agile practices, Technical Architects who provide technical direction, Customer Advocates who represent user needs, Data Analysts who enable data-driven decisions, and QA teams who validate acceptance criteria. Communication follows a structured **cadence** with weekly PM-PdM syncs, regular standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and clear escalation paths to ensure transparency and alignment.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout our workflow with comprehensive **CI/CD practices** including automated unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, and pre-release smoke tests. Our **release and deployment** process standardizes how features move to production through patch, minor, and major releases, each with documented pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback procedures. **Risk management** is proactive and ongoing, tracked in a dedicated risk register with clear mitigation plans and regular reviews. After each sprint, release, or incident, we conduct **retrospectives** to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, ensuring our processes evolve based on real team experience.

Every phase of our project lifecycle is documented to reduce ambiguity, accelerate onboarding, and maintain consistency across teams. The documents below provide detailed guidance on workflows, templates, checklists, and best practices. Use them as your reference for running projects that deliver measurable customer value while maintaining team efficiency and code quality.

## How to Use These Docs

**For new team members:** Start with the [Onboarding Checklist](octoacme-onboarding-checklist.md) for a structured ramp-up, then review the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our principles and lifecycle. Review [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to clarify responsibilities and understand how different roles collaborate. As you work on projects, reference the phase-specific guides (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, Retrospective) for detailed templates and checklists. Use the [Cross-Functional Communication Guide](octoacme-cross-functional-communication.md) to understand how to effectively collaborate across roles.

**For project leads:** Use these documents as templates and checklists to run projects consistently. Keep your Project Charter and artifacts updated in your project repository. Reference the [Role Handoff Checklist](octoacme-role-handoff-checklist.md) when team members transition on or off the project. Consider adding process-specific docs to `.copilot/` directories if you want GitHub Copilot Spaces to use them as context for your team.

**For all contributors:** These docs are living resources. If you identify gaps, want to propose improvements, or need clarification, please submit an issue using our [process documentation update template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml).
